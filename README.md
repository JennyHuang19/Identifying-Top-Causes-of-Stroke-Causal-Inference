# Identifying-Top-Causes-of-Stroke-Causal-Inference

Project for STA671 Machine Learning

Stroke is a heterogeneous syndrome, meaning that it is often difficult to pinpoint its specific causes. The risk factors of stroke can be separated into two broad categories: modifiable and non-modifiable [1]. For example, age, sex, race, and genetics are non-modifiable risk factors, while smoking, diet, and hypertension are commonly reported modifiable risk factors [1].

Recent studies claim that up to 50$\%$ of strokes are preventable [2]. I am interested in quantifying the importance of modifiable risk factors relative to non-modifiable risk factors. If healthcare providers are better able to understand the importance of modifiable risk factors in relation to non-modifiable ones, then they may be able to provide individuals in at-risk populations with more compelling information about the importance of lifestyle change. Furthermore, a patientâ€™s belief in the modifiability of their disease risk often influences their willingness to adapt to healthier lifestyle habits as well as to seek treatment for medical conditions like hypertension and diabetes [2].

Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the United States, and the aging U.S. population is expected to increase the prevalence of stroke by 3.4 million people by the year 2030 [2]. Thus, exploring the causes of stroke as it relates to modifiable health features is of high importance for stroke prevention. Advancements in machine learning, specifically tools in causal inference, can now enable us to gain insight into this important causal question.
